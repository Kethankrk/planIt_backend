# PlanIt
This project outlines the creation of a versatile event management platform designed to simplify the planning and execution of events for organizers, 
as well as enhance the experience for attendees. The platform will allow event organizers to publish events, sell tickets, manage registrations, 
and call for speakers and volunteers, providing a comprehensive toolset for event management. Organizers will also have features to manage and 
schedule their events efficiently. For attendees, the platform offers an intuitive interface to discover events that match their interests and easily 
purchase tickets. By integrating these functionalities, the platform aims to streamline the entire event lifecycle from planning to participation, 
fostering a more organized and engaging event ecosystem.
